      <p className="answer-p">
        A knot is a unit of speed used in navigation and aviation. It is defined
        as one nautical mile per hour (nautical mile/h) and is commonly
        abbreviated as "kn." The term "knot" is derived from the practice of
        using knots tied along a line (usually a log line) to measure the speed
        of a ship at sea.

        Formally, one knot is equal to one nautical mile per hour, where:

        1 knot = 1 nautical mile per hour 1 knot = 1 nautical mile per hour
      </p>
      <p className="answer-p">
        Since a nautical mile is approximately equal to 1.852 kilometers, a knot
        is roughly equivalent to 1.852 kilometers per hour.

      <p className="answer-p">
        Knots are widely used in maritime and aviation contexts for expressing
        the speed of ships and aircraft, respectively. The use of knots is
        preferred in these fields because it directly relates to nautical miles,
        providing a convenient and standardized measure for speed over water or
        air.
