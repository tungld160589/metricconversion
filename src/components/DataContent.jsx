        <p className="span-convert-content">A byte is a unit of digital information used in computer processing and storage.
          A standard byte is made of eight binary digits, which are called bits.
          Originally, bytes could consist of any number of bits, such as six-bit bytes, but eventually, the standard byte was set at 8 bits.</p>
        <p className="span-convert-content">
          A byte is a measurement of data that contains eight bits, which is the smallest increment of data on a computer.
          It’s the smallest addressable unit of memory in most computer architectures, and network protocol documents such as the Internet
          Protocol refer to an 8-bit byte as an octet. A single byte can be used to represent 2 to the 8th or 256 different values.

          Individually, bytes contain little storage. Therefore, the processing and storage capacities of computer hardware are expressed in powers of ten—the traditional kilo-, mega-, giga, tera…— or in powers of two typically in gigabytes (GB) and terabytes (TB).

        <p className="span-convert-content">A bit, short for binary digit, is defined as the most basic unit of data in telecommunications and computing. Each bit is represented by either a 1 or a 0 and this can be executed in various systems through a two-state device. A computer not only initiates multiple instructions that can manipulate and test bits,
          but it also performs these instructions and stores accumulated data in eight-bit parcels called bytes.</p>

          <h4>Gigabyte:</h4>
        </li>
        <p className="span-convert-content">GB is a unit of digital information storage capacity. It is commonly used in technology, computing, programming, and communications. GB is a term you often hear in the tech world.
          It's a unit of measurement used to describe the amount of digital information that can be stored or transmitted.</p>
        <p className="span-convert-content">A gigabyte can hold approximately 1 billion bytes of data.
          When you have a gigabyte of storage, it means you have the capacity to store around 1 billion characters or bytes of data.</p>
        <p className="span-convert-content">In terms of smaller units, a gigabyte is equal to 1,024 megabytes (MB). If you divide a gigabyte into smaller units, you will have around 1,024 megabytes. However,
          a gigabyte is equal to 0.001 terabytes (TB). If you want to express a gigabyte in larger units, it would be around 0.001 terabytes.</p>

        <p className="span-convert-content">In data communications, a gigabit (Gb) is 1 billion bits, or 1,000,000,000 (that is, 109) bits.
          It's commonly used for measuring the amount of data that is transferred in a second between two telecommunication points.</p>
