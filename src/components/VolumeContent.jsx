          English spelling{")"} {"("}SI symbols L and l, other symbol used: ℓ
          {")"} is a metric unit of volume. It is equal to 1 cubic decimetre{" "}
          {"("}dm<sup>3</sup>
          {")"}, 1000 cubic centimetres {"("}cm<sup>3</sup>
          {")"} or 0.001 cubic metre {"("}m<sup>3</sup>

          × 10 cm × 10 cm {"("}see figure

        <p className="span-convert-content">
          The original French metric system used the litre as a base unit. The
          word litre is derived from an older French unit, the litron, whose
          name came from Byzantine Greek—where it was a unit of weight, not
          volume—via Late Medieval Latin, and which equalled approximately 0.831
          litres. The litre was also used in several subsequent versions of the
          metric system and is accepted for use with the SI, although not an SI
          unit—the SI unit of volume is the cubic metre {"("}m<sup>3</sup>
          {")"}. The spelling used by the International Bureau of Weights and
          Measures is "litre", a spelling which is shared by most
          English-speaking countries. The spelling "liter" is predominantly used
          in American English.

          One litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram,
          because the kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one
          cubic decimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice {"("}0 °C
          {")"}. Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that
          this relationship is no longer exact.
