          A square inch (plural: square inches) is a unit of area, equal to the
          area of a square with sides of one inch. The following symbols are

          The square inch is a common unit of measurement in the United States

          inch (psi) is derived from this unit of area.

          Square Feet {"(square foot; abbreviated sq ft, sf, or "}ft<sup>2</sup>
          ; also denoted by'<sup>2</sup>
          {")"} is an imperial unit and U.S. customary unit {"("}non-SI,
          non-metric{")"} of area, used mainly in the United States and
          partially in Canada, the United Kingdom, Bangladesh, India, Nepal,

        <p className="span-convert-content">
          The square metre (international spelling as used by the International
          Bureau of Weights and Measures) or square meter (American spelling) is
          the unit of area in the International System of Units (SI) with symbol
          m<sup>2</sup>. It is the area of a square with sides one metre in
          length.
        </p>
        <p className="span-convert-content">
          Adding and subtracting SI prefixes creates multiples and submultiples;
          however, as the unit is exponentiated, the quantities grow
          exponentially by the corresponding power of 10. For example, 1
          kilometre is 10<sup>3</sup> {"("}one thousand{")"} times the length of
          1 metre, but 1 square kilometre is {"("}10<sup>3</sup>
          {")"}
          <sup>2</sup> {"("}10<sup>6</sup>, one million{")"} times the area of 1
          square metre, and 1 cubic kilometre is {"("}10<sup>3</sup>
          {")"}
          <sup>3</sup> {"("}10<sup>9</sup>, one billion{")"} cubic metres.

        <p className="span-convert-content">
          The acre is a unit of land area used in the British imperial and the
          United States customary systems. It is traditionally defined as the
          area of one chain by one furlong {"("}66 by 660 feet{")"}, which is
          exactly equal to 10 square chains, 1⁄640 of a square mile, 4,840
          square yards, or 43,560 square feet, and approximately 4,047 m
          <sup>2</sup>, or about 40% of a hectare. Based upon the international
          yard and pound agreement of 1959, an acre may be declared as exactly
          4,046.8564224 square metres. The acre is sometimes abbreviated ac but
          is usually spelled out as the word "acre".

          <h4>Hectares:</h4>
        </li>
        <p className="span-convert-content">
          {" "}
          The hectare is a non-SI metric unit of area equal to a square with
          100-metre sides {"("}1 hm<sup>2</sup>
          {")"}, that is, 10,000 square meters {"("}
          10,000 m<sup>2</sup>
          {")"}, and is primarily used in the measurement of land. There are 100
          hectares in one square kilometre. An acre is about 0.405 hectares and
          one hectare contains about 2.47 acres.
        </p>
        <p className="span-convert-content">
          In 1795, when the metric system was introduced, the are was defined as
          100 square metres, or one square decametre, and the hectare {"("}
          "hecto-" + "are"{")"} was thus 100 ares or 1⁄100 km<sup>2</sup> {"("}
          10,000 square metres{")"}. When the metric system was further
          rationalised in 1960, resulting in the International System of Units{" "}
          {"("}SI{")"}, the are was not included as a recognised unit. The
          hectare, however, remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the
          SI and whose use is "expected to continue indefinitely". Though the
          dekare/decare daa {"("}1,000 m<sup>2</sup>
          {")"} and are {"("}100 m<sup>2</sup>
          {")"} are not officially "accepted for use", they are still used in
          some contexts.

          The square mile {"("}abbreviated as sq mi and sometimes as mi
          <sup>2</sup>
          {")"} is an imperial and US unit of measure for area. One square mile
          is equal to the area of a square with each side measuring a length of
          one mile.
        </p>
        <p className="span-convert-content">
          Square miles should not be confused with miles square, a square region
          with each side having a length of the value given. For example, a
          region which is 20 miles square {"("}20 mi × 20 mi{")"} has an area of
          400 sq mi; a rectangle of measuring 10 mi × 40 mi also has an area of
          400 sq mi, but is not 20 miles square.
