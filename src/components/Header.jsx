            Unit conversion is the process of converting a quantity expressed in
            one unit to another. This is done with conversion
            factorsâ€”multipliers that express the relationship between the
            original unit and the desired unit. For example, you can use a
            conversion factor to convert a volume measurement in gallons to
            liters or vice versa.
