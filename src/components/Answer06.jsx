      <p className="answer-p">
        The long ton, short ton, and metric ton are different units of mass or
        weight used in various parts of the world. Here are the differences
        between them:

      <ol className="answer-ol">
        <li className="answer-li-ol">Long Ton:</li>
        <ul className="answer-ul">
          <li className="answer-li-ul">
            Symbol: Sometimes represented as "long ton" or "imperial ton."{" "}
          </li>
          <li className="answer-li-ul">
            Equivalent: 1 long ton is equal to 1.016 metric tons or 1,016
            kilograms.
          </li>
          <li className="answer-li-ul">
            Conversion: 1 long ton is equivalent to 2,240 pounds.{" "}
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li className="answer-li-ol">Short Ton:</li>
        <ul className="answer-ul">
          <li className="answer-li-ul">
            Symbol: Often referred to as just "ton" in the United States.{" "}
          </li>
          <li className="answer-li-ul">
            Equivalent: 1 short ton is equal to 0.907 metric tons or 907.185
            kilograms.
          </li>
          <li className="answer-li-ul">

            pounds.{" "}
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p className="answer-p">
        In summary, the long ton is used in the United Kingdom and some other
        Commonwealth countries, while the short ton is more common in the United
        States. The metric ton is widely used in most other parts of the world
        and is the standard unit in the metric system for measuring mass. When
        dealing with international trade or scientific contexts, it's important
        to be aware of these different ton units and convert between them as
        needed.
